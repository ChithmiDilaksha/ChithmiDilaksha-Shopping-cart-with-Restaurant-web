            <h2 class="productName" id="Kulfi" name="Kulfi" >Kulfi</h2>
            <p class="add-to-cart-paragraph">This traditional Indian ice cream is made by slowly heating sweetened milk until the sugar caramelizes and the milk condenses; the mixture is then frozen in cone-shaped molds without first being whipped or churned. As a result, kulfi is denser and creamier than American ice cream, with a custard-like quality that lends itself well to being served on a stick. Kulfi is frequently flavored with aromatics like cardamom.</p>

            <h2 class="productName" id="RolledIceCream" name="RolledIceCream" >Rolled Ice Cream</h2>
            <p class="add-to-cart-paragraph">This type of ice cream hails from Thailand and is a popular street food throughout Southeast Asia. Here, the standard ingredients (milk, cream, sugar) are heated, aerated and rapidly cooled to produce Swiss roll-style ribbons of ice cream that can be served upright in a cup and finished with a wide variety of toppings. The process is fascinating to watch and the finished product tastes as good as it looks.</p>

            <p class="add-to-cart-paragraph">You won’t find this one in the frozen foods section of the grocery store, but wherever there’s a fair, carnival or ice cream truck, you’ll find folks lining up for soft serve. This type of ice cream is a rapidly churned blend of milk and sugar (no eggs) with a light and airy texture, perfect for swirling into a cone or cup—just be sure to make short work of it, because it will melt faster than ice cream.</p>

            <h2 class="productName" id="Sherbet" name="Sherbet" >Sherbet</h2>
            <p class="add-to-cart-paragraph">Sherbet is a frozen treat made from fruit purée, plus a scant amount of dairy. Although sherbet is always made with some form of dairy—be it milk, cream or even buttermilk—the resulting dessert is distinct from ice cream in that it contains only 1 to 2 percent milkfat, as compared to the 10 percent milkfat found in the latter.</p>

            <p class="add-to-cart-paragraph">Head to Taiwan to indulge in this pillowy mountain of creamy deliciousness—a pile of fluffy and delicate strips of ice cream, shaved off a massive block of the stuff. The most popular toppings, which include sweetened condensed milk, fresh fruit and chocolate, are just the icing on the snow cream cake.</p>

            <h2 class="productName" id="Dondurma" name="Dondurma" >Dondurma</h2>
            <p class="add-to-cart-paragraph">Divinely creamy and dense enough you could eat it with a fork and knife, this Turkish treat is unlike any kind of ice cream you’ve ever tasted. Mastic—an (edible) organic glue made from the resin of the mastic tree—is the secret ingredient responsible for the elastic, taffy-like consistency of dondurma.</p>

            <p class="add-to-cart-paragraph">Although it looks like a kids’ toy from the ‘90s, the rambutan is actually edible. To open a rambutan, cup it in your hands and find a groove between the spikes with your thumbs. Push downwards and then outwards to prise it apart. Once through the fuzzy outer shell you’ll find a glistening lychee-like fruit. Pop it whole in your mouth but make sure you don’t eat the seed.</p>
        </div>

            <h2 class="productName" id="WoodApple" name="WoodApple" >Wood Apple</h2>
            <p class="add-to-cart-paragraph">This singularly odd fruit consists of a hard outer shell and a soft, seeded centre. The best way to break one open is by smashing the shell against the edge of a surface – we recommend a garden wall. The wood Apple is an acquired taste and the texture is a bit gungy and gristly, but it’s definitely worth trying. Wood Apple juices and jams are very tasty.</p>

            <h2 class="productName" id="Dragonfruit" name="Dragonfruit" >Dragonfruit</h2>
            <p class="add-to-cart-paragraph">The taste of the dragonfruit, which comes from the cactus family, is much less distinctive than the colour. The skin is inedible, but once you cut through the pink outer layer you’ll reach a soft, white seeded part, which has a subtly sweet taste. It has a whole load of health benefits, and can be used to soothe sunburn and treat chemically dyed hair.</p>

            <p class="add-to-cart-paragraph">Naminams look more like fungus than fruit, and hang off the bark of the naminam tree in a similarly mouldy fashion. But the wrinkly fruits are much tastier than you might expect; giving off a sharp, sour tang. Perhaps because of their odd appearance markets don’t tend to stock these – you’ll be more likely to find them on the roadside or in someone’s yard.</p>

            <p class="add-to-cart-paragraph">TSri Lanka is particularly famous for sweet, soft, custardy custard apples. Their hard knobbly skin hides the soft sweet pulp inside, this can be eaten with a spoon, chilled. There are four varieties of custard apple grown in Sri Lanka and they each have a unique flavour.</p>

            <p class="add-to-cart-paragraph">The mangosteen is a segmented fruit contained in a purple rind. It’s known as one of the tastiest Sri Lankan fruits. It has immune system-boosting qualities, and is used to make health drinks, tablets and powders. The rind can also be steeped in water to make tea.</p>

            <p class="add-to-cart-paragraph">The cashew nut is actually a seed. It grows underneath the cashew apple – effectively the stem of the nut – that hangs from the tree. The relatively unknown cashew apple contains five times more vitamin C than an orange, but is easily damaged so harder to export.</p>
